## What is this Class?

> The power of data science and machine learning can change the world. From voice activation to video game programming to advancements in medical science - the possibilities for activation are endless. Through this advanced course, students will leverage their foundational knowledge of Python to develop a more sophisticated programming skill set. Further, students will use a variety of mathematical techniques (statistics, linear algebra, and probability) to analyze data and create impactful visualizations. By course completion, students will become well-versed in a range of strategies and techniques in both data science and machine learning and become data-driven decision makers. Further, students will be able to apply communication skills and fairness frameworks to identified solutions, making them invaluable assets to any future data science/machine learning classroom, or future employer.

## What's the Difference from BIGD103?

- There are a few paths into this course:
  - You've taken Data Science and Machine Learning 1 in the Fall
  - You've taken Intro to Python in the Fall
  - You have prior experience with programming, python, data science, and/or machine learning

- Differences
  - Moving faster
  - Going deeper
  - Building applications

_If, in the first few weeks, you feel BIGD103 would be a better fit for you, you can switch!_
