> Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that focuses on building algorithms that rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon. These examples may come from nature, be handcrafted by humans, or generated by another algorithm.

## Types of Learning

### Supervised Learning
The dataset is a collection of labeled examples.

### Unsupervised Learning
The dataset is a collection of unlabeled examples.

### Semi-Supervised Learning
The dataset includes both labeled and unlabeled examples.

### Reinforcement Learning
The machine interacts with an environment to maximize rewards.

## Semi-Supervised Learning

- Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance.
- Adding unlabeled examples can provide more information about the data distribution.

### Examples

- **Image Classification**: Using a few labeled images and many unlabeled images.
- **Speech Recognition**: Using a few labeled audio samples and many unlabeled audio samples.

## Reinforcement Learning

- Involves a machine "living" in an environment, perceiving states, and executing actions to maximize rewards.
- Example applications: Game playing, robotics, resource management.

### Examples

- **Game Playing**: AlphaGo, OpenAI Five
- **Robotics**: Robotic arms, drones
- **AI Model Tuning:** DeepSeek-R1 is big in the news for this!
